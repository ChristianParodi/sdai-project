  tick
end","Moves each turtle forward 1, turns randomly up to 9° right and left, then advances the global tick"
3,"to-report average [a b]
  report (a + b) / 2
end",Defines a reporter that returns the arithmetic mean of two inputs
4,crt 100 [ fd 10 ],Creates 100 turtles at the origin and moves each forward 10 patches
5,hatch 1 [ lt 45 fd 1 ],Each turtle creates one offspring; the new turtle turns left 45° and moves forward 1
6,ask turtles [ set color blue ],Commands every turtle to change its color to blue
7,ask patches with [ pxcor > 0 ] [ set pcolor green ],All patches whose x-coordinate is positive are colored green
8,repeat 10 [ rt random 360 fd 1 ],Repeats 10 times: turn a random heading (0–359°) then move forward 1
9,"ifelse pcolor = green
  [ set pcolor red ]
  [ set pcolor blue ]","If the patch is green, turn it red; otherwise turn it blue"
10,"while [ any? other turtles-here ] [

11,"foreach [1 2 3] [ x -> show (word ""step "" x) ]","Prints “step 1”, “step 2”, and “step 3” by iterating over a list"
12,show mean [sum assets] of turtles,Calculates and displays the average total assets across all turtles

15,"run ""random 10""",Executes the reporter `random 10` at runtime and discards the result
16,"runresult ""count turtles""",Dynamically runs `count turtles` and returns the number of turtles
17,"import-pcolors ""background.jpg""","Loads an image into the patch grid, mapping pixel colors to pcolor"

20,ask turtles [ if count turtles-here > 1 [ die ] ],Each turtle checks for collision and removes itself if sharing the patch
